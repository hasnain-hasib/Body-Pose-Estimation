Real-time Human Pose Detection and Tracking using MediaPipe
This Python script demonstrates real-time human pose detection and tracking using the MediaPipe library. It utilizes the webcam feed to detect and track facial landmarks, hand gestures, and body poses.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe)
Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.
Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
Run the script using the command python real_time_pose_detection.py.
The script will open a window displaying the raw webcam feed with detected landmarks and connections.
Press 'q' to exit the script.
Script Overview
The script first imports necessary libraries: mediapipe for pose detection and OpenCV (cv2) for webcam access and visualization.
It sets up MediaPipe's Holistic model for detecting facial landmarks, hand gestures, and body poses.
The script then initializes the webcam capture.
In the first loop, it simply displays the raw webcam feed until the user presses 'q' to quit.
In the second loop, it captures frames from the webcam, processes them with the Holistic model, and visualizes the detected landmarks and connections on the frames.
Different colors and line thicknesses are used for visualizing different parts of the body.
Pressing 'q' during this loop exits the script.
